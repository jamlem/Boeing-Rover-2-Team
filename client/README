This is the directory for all code/resources for developing the client interface for controlling the rover

Language: C#

Dependencies: None


** Client Information **

The client will be created in C# which will connect to the raspberry pi through its SSH protocol.

The SSH protocol allows for remote control of the terminal within the rapsberry pi. The client
will therefore be able to do the following:

1) run custom terminal commands through the protocol
2) Be able to remotely run scripts/tasks for the raspbery to perform (in this case scripts)
3) allow for remote control over the internet.

The client will send commands to the terminal of the raspberry pi that were given by the user.
These commands can be as simple as a "sh move-forward.sh" command which will run a shell script
that has already been predefined.

There will be two primary forms of control for the user to utilise. they are namely:

1) Through Xbox controller
2) Keyboard input

Intergration of the raspberry camera will be streamed directly onto the client interface. This is
still currently under developement and should be completed by 22/02

The client is still heavily under development and any suggestions or concerns will be noted.

Please feel free to contact me regarding this method.
