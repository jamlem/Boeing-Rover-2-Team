This is the directory for all code/resources for developing the low-level Arduino-Raspberry Pi interface.

Target: Arduino Nano

Language: C++

Dependencies: Arduino Standard library (Arduino.h)


Arduino Communication Protocol:

The interface we will be using is the built-in UART Serial interface. Arduinos usually have a secondary processor
dedicated to reading the built-in serial port, so we can avoid interrupt issues with a software-based solution.

According to my research, Arduino is Full-Duplex (both sides can send data at the same time)

Connection 115200 Baud, 8N1

Arduino to Raspberry Pi (status updates)

The arduino will send a message to the Raspberry pi about every 10 ms. This may change as capabilities are added/removed from the arduino. Bytes:

0: |0x32|  //Magic number. Is an arbitrary number that both systems agree on. (I just chose 0x32 arbitrarily)
1: |...|   //First byte of a float representing the velocity of the right wheel. Network Byte order (Big Endian)
2: |...|   //Part of 1st float
3: |...|   //Part of 1st float
4: |...|   //Part of 1st float
5: |...|   //First byte of a float representing the velocity of the left wheel. Network Byte order (Big Endian)

11:|...|   //Part of 3rd float
12:|...|   //Part of 3rd float

20:|...|   //Part of 5th float
21:|...|   //First byte of a float representing the calculated angular displacement, from arduino power-on. This is using wheel odometry.

35:|...|   //Part of 9th float
36:|...|   //Part of 9th float
37:|...|   //Arduino Status byte. We'll use this bytes for the arduino to report general status info.

Status byte bit assignments:
Key: (U for unused)
ERR:  General error bit. Use if something is fundamentally wrong...
(high order -> low order)

Raspberry Pi to Arduino (Commands)
These can be sent independently of the arduino status commands (communication is full duplex)

For now, there are 3 different commands the raspi can send to the arduino:

1) assign motor speeds:
0: |0x32|  //Magic number. Is an arbitrary number that both systems agree on.
1: |0x00|  //Command type. 0 for assigning speeds for all four motors.
2: |...|   //First byte of a float representing the velocity of the right wheel. Network Byte order (Big Endian)
3: |...|   //Part of 1st float
4: |...|   //Part of 1st float
5: |...|   //Part of 1st float
6: |...|   //First byte of a float representing the velocity of the left wheel. Network Byte order (Big Endian)
7: |...|   //Part of 2nd float
8: |...|   //Part of 2nd float
9: |...|   //Part of 2nd float

2) reset wheel odometry
0: |0x32|  //Magic number. Is an arbitrary number that both systems agree on.
1: |0x01|  //Command type. 1 to reset odometry estimation

3) E-stop. If the arduino recieves this message, it will stop all actuators it is connected to.
0: |0x32|  //Magic number. Is an arbitrary number that both systems agree on.
1: |0x02|  //Command type. 2 for E-Stop.
